## Roadmap

Upcoming features i wish to add to the program.
- Telemetry mode: a near-real time telemetry view of the current launch, featuring things like vertical and horizontal speed, as well as altitude.

- Launch specification: A way of simply following the progress of a single launch at a time, instead of the program deciding what is best.

- Low power mode: A mode which will throttle the refresh time from 1 second, to five seconds, in the default view. Allowing for an even more efficient version of the program.

- custom user color schemes for different launch status types

- Historical launch "replays" for the telemtry mode: does what it says on the tin, allows you to specify a launch, for the telemetry mode to replay in a 1 second refresh view

- Hackerman mode: A less efficient view mode, which randomly changes some of the characters to another character and draws the modified buffer instead of the original, but in a "Matrix Green" font style

- "Wiki" mode: A way of looking at information on a specific launch, agency, rocket, launchpad, or country (generated as the data is located, to prevent)
