Usage
Simply launch the program from your terminal, or file explorer, and it will work out of the box.

For help regarding how to do things within NextLaunch itself, please press F1 when you are using the application, and it will display a helpful popup window.


Why should I upgrade from V1 to V2?
Well, firstly, V1 just really sucks. It is slow, inefficient, and prone to crashing or panicking. Those of you who use the program have more than likely seen a panic since installing it.
V2 doesnt panic, it just doesnt. Everything is coded in a crash resistant way.

Secondly, V2 is multi-threaded, meaning that it is able to do more, in the same amount of time.

Third of all, V2 takes advantage of an updated version of the Launch Library API which it relies on for launch information, as well as a non-retired version of the Space News API which it relies on for news data.

Fourth, finally, and most certainly the best reason to switch, V2 offers an actual user interface, that's right a user interface in the terminal. It is powered by your keyboard and is simple to use and easy to remember.


Credits
Without the following people, services, and open-source libraries, NextLaunch would not have been possible.
Thank you to everyone on this list from the bottom of my heart for helping me make this program,
and putting up with my constant requests for comments on design and style.
